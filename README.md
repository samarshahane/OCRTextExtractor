# OCRTextExtractorWithFormatting

This project is a simple FastAPI web app that extracts text from scanned PDFs or images (JPG/PNG) while preserving formatting like alignment, font size, and tables. It uses EasyOCR and pdfplumber for processing, and lets users preview the extracted text in the browser and download it as a formatted DOCX file. The interface is built with HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templates.
